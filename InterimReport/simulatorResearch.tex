In this section we will look at a large variety of different simulators, to determine which one best suits our purpose. We will be looking at which operating system and game engine the simulator uses, whether or not it is open source, and the pros and cons of each simulator. 
\\~\\
The purpose of this was to get a good understanding of the different simulators currently in existence. The aim was to find 3-4 simulators that would be worth looking closer at.

%%%%%%%% 4DV-Sim %%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{4DV-Sim}
\textbf{Description:} 4DV-Sim\footnote{Website: https://www.4d-virtualiz.com/en/automotive-simulator/} is a simulator that is designed to emulate the hardware and sensors in autonomous systems. This is a professional product and has a variety of use cases from simulating farming to military.

\textbf{Open Source:} No

\textbf{Operating System:} Linux

\textbf{Game Engine:} Non, but it does use PhysX for the physics engine

\textbf{Pros:} The simulator has a lot of available APIs. The simulator also comes with a configurable GUI to set up the simulation environment how you would like it. Also, as it is professionally made, it looks very good.   

\textbf{Cons:} It is not designed to train machine learning implementations on the simulator, but rather emulate a current hardware setup. Also, as it is not open source, it will not be something that we could modify or expand upon to suit our purposes. 

\textbf{Conclusion:} As 4DV-Sim is not an open-source product it is not something that we can use for this project. It is however interesting to see that simulators like this are needed not just for research purposes, but for customers who want to try out their hardware setup in an emulated environment.
