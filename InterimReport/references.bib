pages="293--308",
abstract="In this chapter we describe our robot simulator. We start with the overall structure of the software package containing the controller framework, the physics simulator and external tools. The controller framework makes it very easy to develop and test our algorithms, be it in simulations or with real robots. The physics simulator can handle rigid bodies with fixed geometric representation that are connected by actuated joints. Particular efforts have been undertaken to develop an elaborated treatment of physical object interactions including friction, elasticity, and slip. The chapter also briefly discusses the generation of virtual creatures, the user interface and the most important features of the LpzRobots simulation environment.",

abstract="This chapter describes the `circuits of cultural software' as a framework that guides the book and its analysis; offers a preliminary definition of game engines; and introduces the Unity game engine as the book's core case study. It also discusses key terms such as cultural software, proprietary and commercial game engines, workflow, grain, literacy, and governance, and situates the book in relation to existing research on videogame production, game engines, and software culture. It briefly discusses Unity's place in Australia's videogame industry---which is where the research for the book was conducted---and provides a chapter outline.",
