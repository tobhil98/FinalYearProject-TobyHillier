abstract = {The Container Loading Problem (CLP) is an optimization challenge where the constraint of dynamic stability plays a significant role. The evaluation of dynamic stability requires the use of dynamic simulations that are carried out either with dedicated simulation software that produces very small errors at the expense of simulation speed, or real-time physics engines that complete simulations in a very short time at the cost of repeatability. One such engine, PhysX, is evaluated to determine the feasibility of its integration with the open source application PackageCargo. A simulation tool based on PhysX is proposed and compared with the dynamic simulation environment of Autodesk Inventor to verify its reliability. The simulation tool presents a dynamically accurate representation of the physical phenomena experienced by cargo during transportation, making it a viable option for the evaluation of dynamic stability in solutions to the CLP.},

abstract = {Legged locomotion systems, especially anthropomorphic mechanisms, can be modeled by using highly complex dynamic structures. In order to model these complex dynamic structures, some assumptions must be made, such as no-friction, rigid links or non-redundancy. However, with the dynamic simulators developed in recent years, it has become possible to create dynamic models without making any assumptions. In this study, a posture control algorithm was developed to automatically balance a six-legged mobile robot against external dynamic effects such as incline or contact polygon changes. A model-based control structure is preferred in order to implement the posture control algorithm to the robot control. The reference model used in model-based control was created using the ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) physics simulator. The reference model created on the ODE is always in communication with the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor connected to the robot's body. For this reason, all the dynamic effects including externally applied forces to the real robot can be considered in the control process without making any assumptions. Consequently, real-time application results of the six-legged mobile robot on a moving platform are observed and the results have shown better performance as depicted on graphs.},

abstract={A number of companies including Google and BMW are currently working on the development of autonomous cars. But if fully autonomous cars are going to drive on our roads, it must be decided who is to be held responsible in case of accidents. This involves not only legal questions, but also moral ones. The first question discussed is whether we should try to design the tort liability for car manufacturers in a way that will help along the development and improvement of autonomous vehicles. In particular, Patrick Lin's concern that any security gain derived from the introduction of autonomous cars would constitute a trade-off in human lives will be addressed. The second question is whether it would be morally permissible to impose liability on the user based on a duty to pay attention to the road and traffic and to intervene when necessary to avoid accidents. Doubts about the moral legitimacy of such a scheme are based on the notion that it is a form of defamation if a person is held to blame for causing the death of another by his inattention if he never had a real chance to intervene. Therefore, the legitimacy of such an approach would depend on the user having an actual chance to do so. The last option discussed in this paper is a system in which a person using an autonomous vehicle has no duty (and possibly no way) of interfering, but is still held (financially, not criminally) responsible for possible accidents. Two ways of doing so are discussed, but only one is judged morally feasible.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) and its role in autonomous systems have promised everything from utopian freedom to existential dystopia. The unfilled hyperbole surrounding past and present promises regarding AI futures has left many people skeptical, afraid, or just confused. Rational discussion is often left in the wake due to the fears and fantasy evoked by the press and Hollywood. Fortunately, as a byproduct, this has resulted in a blossoming of worldwide discourse on the ethical implications of the intelligent machines we are creating. Many near and mid-term ethical concerns have arisen with the advent of autonomous systems: particularly regarding driverless cars, privacy and drones, companion- and intimate robotics, the displacement of jobs by intelligent machines, and warfighting robots among others. The IEEE Global Initiative on the Ethics of Autonomous Systems, the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the White House, and the Future of Life Institute are among many responsible organizations that are now considering the ramifications of the real-world consequences of machine autonomy as we continue to stumble about trying to find a way forward.},

That is an important but insufficient step towards determining how the technology will impact human lives and society more generally. What must complement ongoing discussions is a broader, system level of analysis that engages with the interactions and effects that these cars will have on one another and on the socio-technical systems in which they are embedded. To bring the conversation of self-driving cars to the system level, we make use of two traffic scenarios which highlight some of the complexities that designers, policymakers, and others should consider related to the technology. We then describe three approaches that could be used to address such complexities and their associated shortcomings. We conclude by bringing attention to the “Moral Responsibility for Computing Artifacts: The Rules”, a framework that can provide insight into how to approach ethical issues related to self-driving cars.},

In the first part, perception systems are categorized as environment perception systems and positioning estimation systems. The paper presents the physical fundamentals, principle functioning, and electromagnetic spectrum used to operate the most common sensors used in perception systems (ultrasonic, RADAR, LiDAR, cameras, IMU, GNSS, RTK, etc.). Furthermore, their strengths and weaknesses are shown, and the quantification of their features using spider charts will allow proper selection of different sensors depending on 11 features. In the second part, the main elements to be taken into account in the simulation of a perception system of an AV are presented. For this purpose, the paper describes simulators for model-based development, the main game engines that can be used for simulation, simulators from the robotics field, and lastly simulators used specifically for AV. Finally, the current state of regulations that are being applied in different countries around the world on issues concerning the implementation of autonomous vehicles is presented.},

The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research.
This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone platform elements that can be used for research and development. The survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone platforms and compares their main features.},

abstract = {While many firms in recent years have started to offer public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), firms struggle with shaping digital platform strategies that align API design with aspired business goals and the demands of external developers. We address the lack of theory that explains the performance impacts of three API archetypes (professional, mediation, and open asset services). We couple survey data from 152 API product managers with manually coded API design classifications. With this data, we conduct cluster and regression analyses that reveal moderating effects of two value creation strategies (economies of scope in production and innovation) on the relationships between API archetype similarity and two API performance outcomes: return on investment and diffusion. We contribute to IS literature by developing a unifying theory that consolidates different theoretical perspectives on API design, by extending current knowledge on the performance effects of API design, and by empirically studying the distinct circumstances under which digital platforms facilitate economies of scope in production or in innovation. Our results provide practical implications on how API providers can align API archetype choice with the value creation strategy and the API's business objective.},

abstract={This study investigates the challenges and opportunities pertaining to transportation policies that may arise as a result of emerging autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies. AV technologies can decrease the transportation cost and increase accessibility to low-income households and persons with mobility issues. This emerging technology also has far-reaching applications and implications beyond all current expectations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the relevant literature and explores a broad spectrum of issues from safety to machine ethics. An indispensable part of a prospective AV development is communication over cars and infrastructure (connected vehicles). A major knowledge gap exists in AV technology with respect to routing behaviors. Connected-vehicle technology provides a great opportunity to implement an efficient and intelligent routing system. To this end, we propose a conceptual navigation model based on a fleet of AVs that are centrally dispatched over a network seeking system optimization. This study contributes to the literature on two fronts: (i) it attempts to shed light on future opportunities as well as possible hurdles associated with AV technology; and (ii) it conceptualizes a navigation model for the AV which leads to highly efficient traffic circulations.},

abstract = {In this paper, an analysis of the effect of autonomous driving vehicles on traffic breakdown in mixed traffic flow consisting of randomly distributed human driving and autonomous driving vehicles is made. Autonomous vehicles based on classical (standard) adaptive cruise control (ACC) in a vehicle and on an ACC in the framework of three-phase traffic theory (TPACC – Three-traffic-Phase ACC) introduced recently [Phys. Rev. E 97 (2018) 042303] are considered. Due to the particular importance of characteristics of traffic breakdown (transition from free traffic flow to congested traffic) for almost all approaches to traffic control and management in traffic networks, the basis of this paper is a study of the effect of autonomous vehicles on the probability of traffic breakdown and on stochastic highway capacity in mixed traffic flow. We show that within a wide range of dynamic parameters of classical ACC, the ACC-vehicles can deteriorate the traffic system considerably while initiating traffic breakdown and reducing highway capacity at a bottleneck. Contrarily, in the same range of parameters of dynamic rules of TPACC, the TPACC-vehicles either do not effect on traffic characteristics or sometimes can even improve them. To understand physical reasons for the effect of classical ACC- and TPACC-vehicles on traffic breakdown, we introduce a model of ACC that can be considered a combination of dynamic features of classical ACC and TPACC. With the use of this model, we find how the amplitude of a local speed disturbance caused by the ACC in a vicinity of a bottleneck and the probability of traffic breakdown depends on the dynamic parameters of the ACC. To emphasize that the deterioration of the characteristics of mixed traffic flow through classical ACC-vehicles is not associated with a well-known effect of string instability of platoons of autonomous vehicles, we limit by a consideration of only such classical ACC-vehicles whose platoon satisfies condition for string stability.

abstract = {This book provides a holistic perspective on Digital Twin (DT) technologies, and presents cutting-edge research in the field. It assesses the opportunities that DT can offer for smart cities, and covers the requirements for ensuring secure, safe and sustainable smart cities. Further, the book demonstrates that DT and its benefits with regard to: data visualisation, real-time data analytics, and learning leading to improved confidence in decision making; reasoning, monitoring and warning to support accurate diagnostics and prognostics; acting using edge control and what-if analysis; and connection with back-end business applications hold significant potential for applications in smart cities, by employing a wide range of sensory and data-acquisition systems in various parts of the urban infrastructure. The contributing authors reveal how and why DT technologies that are used for monitoring, visualising, diagnosing and predicting in real-time are vital to cities’ sustainability and efficiency. The concepts outlined in the book represents a city together with all of its infrastructure elements, which communicate with each other in a complex manner. Moreover, securing Internet of Things (IoT) which is one of the key enablers of DT’s is discussed in details and from various perspectives. The book offers an outstanding reference guide for practitioners and researchers in manufacturing, operations research and communications, who are considering digitising some of their assets and related services. It is also a valuable asset for graduate students and academics who are looking to identify research gaps and develop their own proposals for further research.},
