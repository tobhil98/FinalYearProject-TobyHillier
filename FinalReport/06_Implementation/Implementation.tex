This chapter looks at what features were implemented or has been attempted throughout the project. The chapter has been split into 3 main sections. The first section will cover how the missing features were added to AirSim and how the simulator was adapted to better fit this project. The second part will cover how reinforcement learning using ML-Agents was used to create autonomous systems so that every agent would not have to be controlled at once. And the last section will cover how to create maps and environments that can be used within the simulator.

% \subsection{AirSim}
% AirSim is missing pedestrians, and this has been the first and main priority for the time being. The plan is to add pedestrians in such a way that it will be easy to add cyclists and other mobile robots soon after that. As can be seen in the timeline (Section~\ref{timeline}) this is expected to take roughly 3 weeks. This is also due to the fact that other commitments have been pushed back slightly due to this Interim Report. In AirSim currently we have got a character added, but the character does not yet have any ability to be spawned in or controlled.
% \\~\\
% AirSim has a lot of available APIs, and the hope is to either incorporate them, or follow their specification when implementing our own. AirSim has a lot of documentation to help with this. There is also an active community where developers can go and ask questions. 
% \\~\\
% AirSim is built using both Unreal Engine and also Unity. For the time being the plan is to only use Unreal Engine. This is to prioritise rapid development rather than cross game engine compatibility. 
% \\~\\
% An advantage of using AirSim is that it could later allow us to use drones in the simulation. This is however not something that will be looked at yet and the feature will be ignored for the time being.
