This chapter will look at the performance of the Simulator as a whole as well as the performance of the ML-Agents. As this is only a prototype the performance is not the most important aspect. The chapter will also look at how the simulator was tested.

% As this is an implementation project, most of the testing was discussed in the Implemenation section.
