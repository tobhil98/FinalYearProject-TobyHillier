\begin{abstract}
Autonomous systems are becoming ever more common in modern society, prompting the creation of traffic simulators to help train and test these systems in a safe environment. This report covers the analysis of existing traffic simulators, and the design and implementation of a simulator to incorporate mixed traffic simulation. The proposed solution consolidates a variety of features such as pedestrians, autonomous vehicles and custom environments into one simulator, which all can be accessed and controlled through external APIs.
