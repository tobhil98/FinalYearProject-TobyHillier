\begin{abstract}
Autonomous systems are becoming ever more common in modern society, prompting the creation of traffic simulators to help train and test these systems in a safe environment. This report covers the analysis of existing traffic simulators, and the design and implementation of a simulator to incorporate mixed traffic simulation. The proposed solution also looks at different ways to create custom environments of real-world locations. The project consolidates a variety of features such as autonomous vehicles, pedestrians and a large variety of external APIs. The project differs from existing mixed traffic simulators due to its simple, versatile design. The solution extends the open-source simulator called AirSim created by Microsoft. The project also looks at using reinforcement learning by applying ML-Agents from Unity to create autonomous vehicles for the simulator.
