I would first and foremost like to thank Professor Yiannis Demiris, for supporting me and allowing me the freedom to explore what interests me and extend the project in any direction. 

Additionally, I would like to thank Dr Xingchen Zhang, for the outstanding support and advice he provided throughout this project.

I would also like to thank my parents for their support throughout university. 

Finally, I would like to thank the family for having me for weekend visits and for good times at Winchelsea Beach.
